## General Information
- Multiple Linear Regression performed on the Boombikes bike rental dataset as part of an assignment for coursework in the course Executive PG in Machine Learning and AI from IIIT Bangalore..
- The project is done as part of coursework in the Machine Learning module
- We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
- The Boombikes bike rental dataset is being used.



## Conclusions
- From the analysis of the categorical variables from the dataset it could be inferred the bike rental rates are likely to be higher in summer and winter, are more prominent in the months of September, more so in the days of Sat and in the year of 2019 
- The R-squared value of the train set is 83% whereas the test set has a value of 79.6% which suggests that our model broadly explains the variance quite accurately on the test set and thus we can conclude that it is a good model.
- Our developed model's mean squared error is almost 0 on both the training and testing datasets which suggests that the variance is accurately predicted on the test set. The p-values and VIF were used to select the significant variables. RFE was also conducted for automated selection of predictors..
